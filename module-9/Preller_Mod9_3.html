			<h2>Daniel Preller</h2>
			<p class="intro"><span class="sentence">My name is Daniel Preller, and I live in a fairly small town in Maryland. </span>
				I live here with my family, and we have been here for as long as I can remember.
				I also have several pets, which currently include a dog, a sugar glider, six chickens, a leopard gecko, three turtles, and several fish.
			</p>
			<p>I live with my mother and stepfather.
				My father and stepmother live about half an hour away, just slightly in Pennsylvania.
				My grandparents on my stepfather’s side live also live half an hour away, though not quite in the same direction, and my grandmother on my mother’s side lives just a few minutes from them.
				Additionally, my aunt, uncle, and two cousins live ten minutes from me.
			</P>
			<P>I am currently an online student at Bellevue University studying software development.
				I am in my fourth year of college, but because I transferred with an associate's degree to another school and then transferred some credits from that school to Bellevue, I still have about a year before I graduate.
				When I graduate, I hope to begin an entry-level job in computer programming and advance from there.
				Currently, I also work part-time making balloon animals at various events and festivals.
			</P>
			<p>In my free time, I enjoy doing many different things.
				My primary hobby, however, is playing video games, and I also love watching livestreams.
				I often enjoy reading and playing board and card games as well. I have several other hobbies that I do less frequently.
				Baking and drawing have been particular interests recently. Beyond this, I enjoy playing piano every day, and I am studying Japanese and practice it daily.
			</p>

				As they are my primary hobby, I have played many video games over the years. 
				My favorite, however, is Stardew Valley. Stardew Valley is a 2D, top-down, pixel-art <span id = "firstValue">_______</span> game. 
				Although far from the only game in its genre, Stardew Valley stands out to me among the crowd. 
				It was developed by a single developer, and it has received several major updates over the years since its launch. 
				Through these updates, the developer has continued to pour his passion into the game and make it something truly special.
			</p>
			<p class = "JSDemo">
				After being aware of the game for a couple years, I first played it in the beginning of 2021. 
				Ever since that first day, I have been hooked. The slow pace of the game provides a relaxed environment, and yet there is no shortage of challenges and goals to reach. 
				The <span id = "secondValue">__________</span> of the world immerses players into whatever season or situation they are playing in, transporting them out of their current time into the world of the game. 
				Spring feels fresh and full of new life, Summer feels vibrant and energetic, <span id = "thirdValue">____</span> is relaxed with a touch of spookiness, and Winter is calm but exciting as players prepare for the coming Spring. 
				The game’s characters also pull players in, with interactions and narratives that make the game feel full of life.
			</p>
			<p class = "JSDemo">
				Over the following years, I have played countless games, but Stardew Valley has remained my favorite. 
				It has always provided a time to clear my mind and a world that I can look forward to visiting. 
				I always have new goals to reach and new <span id = "fourthValue">_____</span> to make. 
				No matter what games I have been playing at any time, Stardew Valley has always been a game that I continue going back to.
