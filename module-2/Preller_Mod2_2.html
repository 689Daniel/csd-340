		<h2>Daniel Preller</h2>
		<p class="intro"><span class="sentence">My name is Daniel Preller, and I live in a fairly small town in Maryland. </span>
			I live here with my family, and we have been here for as long as I can remember.
			I also have several pets, which currently include a dog, a sugar glider, six chickens, a leopard gecko, three turtles, and several fish.
		</p>
		<p>I live with my mother and stepfather.
			My father and stepmother live about half an hour away, just slightly in Pennsylvania.
			My grandparents on my stepfather’s side live also live half an hour away, though not quite in the same direction, and my grandmother on my mother’s side lives just a few minutes from them.
			Additionally, my aunt, uncle, and two cousins live ten minutes from me.
		</P>
		<P>I am currently an online student at Bellevue University studying software development.
			I am in my fourth year of college, but because I transferred with an associate's degree to another school and then transferred some credits from that school to Bellevue, I still have about a year before I graduate.
			When I graduate, I hope to begin an entry-level job in computer programming and advance from there.
			Currently, I also work part-time making balloon animals at various events and festivals.
		</P>
		<p>In my free time, I enjoy doing many different things.
			My primary hobby, however, is playing video games, and I also love watching livestreams.
			I often enjoy reading and playing board and card games as well. I have several other hobbies that I do less frequently.
			Baking and drawing have been particular interests recently. Beyond this, I enjoy playing piano every day, and I am studying Japanese and practice it daily.
